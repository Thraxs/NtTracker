<h1 align="center">Neonate Tracker</h1>

#####Current version: 1.0.0
This is a web application for tracking neonates at risk of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. It was developed as a final degree project for my Software Engineering Degree. The idea of the application is from a pediatrician from the Virgen Macarena Hospital (Seville, Spain).
